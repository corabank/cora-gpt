- The app should use Python 3.10 and openai 0.27.0 and streamlit 1.21.0
- You should avoid using dropdown menu, use tabs instead.
- The app will display the generated image on the screen.
- The app will handle errors and display error messages if image generation fails.
- The app will be fully functional and responsive, allowing users to use it on any device or screen size.
- You should generate a requirements.txt file at the root of the project
- You should genereate a README.md file
- The environment variables are saved in a `.env` file at the root of the project.
- You should use these patterns when calling APIs:
```
# when using image API
response = openai.Image.create(
  prompt="prompt goes here",
  n=1,
  size="512x512"
)
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
```
```
# when using completion API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "You are an insightful assistant."},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Prompt goes here"},
  temperature=0.7,
  max_tokens=400
)
text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```
